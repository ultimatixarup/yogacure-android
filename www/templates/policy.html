This data includes specific details of the workouts you perform ("Practice Data"). We will treat your Personal Information and Practice Data as confidential (see relevant sections below). We will not share your Personal Information or Practice Data with third parties, such as third party service providers and/or advertisers, without your permission.

Apple Health App Integration</b></br/>

You may opt to integrate YogaCure with Apple's App Database. If you grant YogaCure access to Apple's App Database, YogaCure will import your data from the App Database into the Application in certain circumstances, such as to aid you in the tracking of practice goals. In addition, YogaCure may transfer data that you store locally on your Device, such as calories burned information, to the App Database. YogaCure cannot read from or write to the App Database unless you grant access. Data accessed from the App Database will never be shared with third parties, such as third party service providers and/or advertisers, without your permission.
</p>
<p>
YogaCure is in no way responsible for the protection of the Practice Data and/or other information stored within Apple's App Database. You and Apple are solely responsible for the protection of such information in the App Database. Please review Apple's applicable policies and procedures before syncing and backing up your Practice Data and/or other information with the App Database.

Security
</b>
<br/>
We take reasonable steps to protect information about you that is in our possession and control, such as your Personal Information and Practice Data, from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Unfortunately, no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, email sent between you and us may not be secure, due, for instance, to the security practices that you, your email carrier, and/or Internet provider employ. You should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal data to us via the Internet. You are solely responsible for the protection of your Device, including any use of YogaCure or any storage of Personal Information or Practice Data incident to the use of YogaCure on your Device. Please consult your Device's documentation on how to manage local storage and how to apply appropriate security controls to the Device for the protection of information such as passwords. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Device password. Personal Information or Practice Data that is stored on your Device is your responsibility. In the event that your Device becomes lost or inoperable, your Practice Data may not be recoverable (see relevant sections above).

At times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy such as due to changes in the services we offer, Apple's policies and procedures, and/or the applicable laws.
